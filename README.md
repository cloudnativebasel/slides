# Cloud Native Basel slides

Welcome to the Cloud Native Basel slides repository! This repository is dedicated to storing and archiving all slide decks presented at our events, meetups, keynotes, and other related activities.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized using a folder structure that groups slides based on the date of each event. Each event folder contains the respective slide decks along with any additional media content that was made available. The folders are ordered in descending order, with the newest/latest events at the top.


## Contributing

If you have presented a slide deck at one of our events and would like to contribute it to the repository, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Create a new folder in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-event` for the event, using the date of the event.
3. Add your slide deck file(s) and any associated media content to the event folder.
4. Optionally, provide a brief description or summary of your presentation in the README.md file within the event folder.
5. Commit your changes and submit a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.

ℹ️ **Please note that the preferred format for your slide decks is pdf.** If you decide to provide alternative, modifiable formats such as .pptx or similar, please leave a notice about your desired license for that content, so no bad surprises could arise in the future.

## Usage

To access the slide decks from past events, navigate through the repository's folder structure. Each event folder contains the slide deck files and other media content associated with that specific event.

You can clone the repository using the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cloudnativebasel/slides.git
```

Alternatively, you can download individual slide decks directly from the GitHub interface.
